An example of my code structure from a pair-programming personal project. Code is truncated for confidentiality.

Goal: 
1. Create a web crawler that fetch textual data from an API. Make it async for speed. -> :white_check_mark: Done
2. Package, test and dockerize it. -> :white_check_mark: Done
3. Load in a self-hosted datalake (mongodb) -> :white_check_mark: Done
4. Train a small homemade transformer model -> :pause_button: On hold
